# Hi there! I'm Dan.
### Few words about me:
Few years ago I've discovered programming is not as difficult as it seems (it's much more difficult), completely fell in love with it and decided to pursue web development as a career. I enjoy learning, able to switch between perfectionism and pragmatism and love a challange.
The green dots on my GitHub profile represent my journey from being curious about programing to becoming proficient and confident developer, gaps are mainly learning periods and real life - sadly can't code all the time.

### Technologies I work with:
- My main expertise lies in Javascript and related front-end technologies: React, Html with CSS.
- Bootstrap and styled-components for layout and styling.
- I've worked with PHP and Laravel, MVC architecture and API, and used Sass in a few projects.
- Used relational databases, I'm most familiar with MySql.

### What I'm learning next:
- C#, .NET6, I'm currently building a project based on those technologies, which will be linked in my portfolio.
- MongoDB, I intend to use it in the project as my database.
- Azure for cloud services.
