# Hi there! I'm Dan.
### Few words about me:
I'm a techonology enthusiast, few years ago I've discovered programming is not as difficult as it seems (it's much more difficult), completely fell in love with it and decided to pursue software development as a career. I enjoy learning, able to switch between perfectionism and pragmatism and love a challange.
The green dots on my GitHub profile represent my journey from being curious about programing to becoming proficient and confident developer, gaps are mainly learning periods and real life - sadly can't code 24/7.

### Technologies I work with:
- My main expertise lies in Javascript and related front-end technologies: React, Html with CSS.
- I've worked with PHP and Laravel, MVC architecture and API, and used Sass in few projects.
- Used relational and non relational databases, MySql and MongoDB are the ones I'm most familiar with.

### What I'm learning next:
- C#, .NET6, I'm currently building a project based on those technologies, which will be linked in my portfolio.
- MongoDB, I intend to use it in the project as my database.
- Azure
