# Hi there! I'm Dan.
### Few words about me:
I'm a techonology enthusiast, few years ago I've discovered programming is not as difficult as it seems (it's much more difficult), completely fell in love with it and decided to pursue software development as a career. I enjoy learning, able to switch between perfectionism and pragmatism and love a challange.
The green dots on my GitHub profile represent my journey from being curious about programing to becoming proficient and confident developer, gaps are mainly learning periods and real life - sadly can't code 24/7.

### Technologies I work with:
- My main expertise lies in Javascript and related front-end technologies: React, Html with CSS.
- I've worked with relational databases, mainly MySQL.
- I'm also familiar with PHP and Laravel and used Sass in few projects.

### What I'm learning?
- C#, .NET and Azure are next one the agenda, I'm currently building a project based on those technologies, which will be linked in my portfolio.
- MongoDB, I intend to use it in the project as my database.
